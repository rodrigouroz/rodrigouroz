### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rodrigo Uroz and I've been working as a Software Engineer for over 25 years.

Yes, I was around when the Outlook team at Microsot developed the XMLHttpRequest standard that became the origin of what was later known as Ajax. We have definitely come a long way from that to the current state of the art of HTTP2 (with server push), stale-while-revalidate, React, etc. I also witnessed the transition from 
SOAP to REST and now GraphQL.

Since then I haven't stopped working in IT, taking different roles.

I love using computers to solve problems and to advance as a society. I feel passion in building software, I understood that when I shifted to an Engineering Manager role and still felt the urge to keep coding. I recently started working in https://askholidays.vercel.app as a mean to keep at it.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://sepame.net, a site that processes over 15M records of products in Argentina and index them to be easily searched and compared by location and price.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: rodrigouroz@gmail.com, [@rodrigouroz](https://twitter.com/rodrigouroz), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigouroz/)

âš¡ Fun facts: I love playing videogames, something I started doing with my daugher recently and when she's old enough I'll teach her how to code because I truly believe coding is the language of the future. I also play the piano, I started a few years ago and I love it.

And always remember:
