### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rodrigo Uroz and I've been working as a Software Engineer for almost 20 years now.

Yes, I was around when the Outlook team at Microsot developed the XMLHttpRequest standard that became the origin of what was later known as Ajax. We have definitely come a long way from that to the current state of the art of HTTP2 (with server push), stale-while-revalidate, React, etc. I also witnessed the transition from 
SOAP to REST and now GraphQL.

Since then I haven't stopped working in IT, taking different roles.

I love using computers to solve problems and to advance as a society. I feel passion in building software, I understood that when I shifted to an Engineering Manager role and still felt the urge to keep coding. I recently started working in https://askholidays.vercel.app as a mean to keep at it.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://askholidays.vercel.app, a site that uses NLP (through wit.ai) and a holidays API to answer questions such as: 
* _what are the next three holidays in the USA?_ 
* _is there a holiday in Argentina in October?_ 
* _when is labour day in the USA?_ 

Try it out! I wanted to test Next.js and Vercel and I came with the idea of having a tool that I find handy each time a global team is doing a planning session.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Apollo and GraphQL in general. I also recently started doing challenges in hackerrank, I like being challenged ðŸ˜„

âš¡ Fun facts: I love playing videogames, something I started doing with my daugher recently and when she's old enough I'll teach her how to code because I truly believe coding is the language of the future. I also play the piano, I started a few years ago and I love it.
